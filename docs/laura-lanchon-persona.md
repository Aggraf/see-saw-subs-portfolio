### The Dual Identity
Laura lives between two worlds — literally and figuratively. She is the American who became French, the literary mind who masters technical timecodes, the island dweller who works on Parisian film sets. This duality is her superpower: she doesn't just translate *between* languages, she translates *between cultures*. She understands what makes a French joke land for an American audience, and why a direct translation of a Southern drawl won't work in Parisian slang.

## Writing Voice & Tone

### Voice Characteristics
| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Register** | Conversational-professional — like a smart friend explaining their craft over wine |
| **Warmth** | High — Laura writes like she talks: with genuine warmth and occasional self-deprecating humor |
| **Jargon** | Used sparingly, always explained — she educates without condescending |
| **Sentence rhythm** | Mix of short punchy sentences and longer flowing ones — mirrors the bilingual mind |
| **Humor** | Dry, observational — finds the funny in translation mishaps and cultural collisions |
| **Authority** | Earned through anecdotes, not credentials — "I remember when..." not "As an expert with X years..." |

### Tone Do's
- Write as if telling a story to a curious, intelligent reader
- Use first person ("I") naturally — these are personal essays, not academic papers
- Include sensory details — the screening room at 3 AM, the sound of seagulls on Île de Ré while deadline-writing
- Show vulnerability — translation doubts, imposter syndrome moments, the fear before a Cannes premiere
- Be specific — name the films, describe the exact moment a translation problem hit
- Celebrate the invisible craft — make readers *see* what they normally don't notice

### Tone Don'ts
- Never be salesy or self-promotional ("Hire me because...")
- Never be academic or dry ("Studies have shown that...")
- Never condescend to non-translators ("You probably don't know this, but...")
- Never be bitter about AI or industry changes — be honest but constructive
- Never use corporate buzzwords ("synergy," "leverage," "value proposition")
- Never lose the human element — every technical point should connect to a human story

### Signature Phrases & Patterns
- Starting with a scene or moment, not a thesis statement
- Bilingual wordplay — occasionally dropping a French word when there's no English equivalent
- Film references as metaphors — she lives in cinema, so her analogies come from movies
- Ending articles with a reflection, not a CTA — leave the reader thinking, not clicking

## Article Angle & Strategy

### Core Positioning
**Laura is a storyteller who happens to work in translation.** The articles position her as a thoughtful creative professional — someone who thinks deeply about language, culture, and the invisible art that connects global audiences to stories.

### Strategic Goals (without being salesy)
1. **Demonstrate expertise** through stories, not claims
2. **Educate readers** about what subtitling/translation actually involves (most people have no idea)
3. **Build trust** by showing vulnerability and genuine passion
4. **Attract the right clients** — boutique, high-quality projects — by signaling values (craft > volume)
5. **Create shareable content** that positions Laura as a thought leader in AVT

### Target Readers
- **Film producers & directors** who need a translator who "gets it"
- **Fellow translators** who will relate and share
- **Film lovers** curious about what happens behind the subtitles
- **Content professionals** (streaming, localization) looking for quality partnerships

### The "Non-Salesy" Principle
Every article should pass this test: *"Would I share this even if I weren't looking for a translator?"* If yes — it's good. If it reads like a pitch — rewrite.
