## All 10 Proposals

### 1. "From New York to Île de Ré: How I Accidentally Became a French Subtitler"
**Category:** Personal / Origin Story
**Why:** Every great portfolio needs an origin story. This humanizes Laura immediately — the American girl who moved to France at 22 and discovered that her bilingual brain was perfectly wired for a career she didn't know existed. It's relatable, shareable, and sets up her unique positioning.
**Summary:** Laura recounts her early years in France — the culture shock, the moment she realized she was thinking in two languages simultaneously, her first clumsy translation job, and the path that led from odd jobs to subtitling a Cannes film. Weaves in the romance of Île de Ré and the reality of building a freelance career in a niche industry.
**Hook:** "I didn't choose subtitling. Subtitling chose me — at 2 AM in a Parisian editing suite, with a deadline in four hours and a French director who didn't believe English could carry his poetry."

### 2. "The 40-Character Cage: What It Really Takes to Subtitle a Film"
**Category:** Craft / Education
**Why:** Most people have zero idea what subtitling involves technically. This article pulls back the curtain on the constraints — 40 characters per line, 15 characters per second reading speed, shot changes, spotting — and shows how creativity thrives inside limitation. Positions Laura as a technical master.
**Summary:** A deep dive into the mechanics of subtitling using real examples from Laura's work. Explains CPS (characters per second), line segmentation, the art of condensation (cutting 30% of dialogue without losing meaning), and why a subtitle is closer to haiku than to translation. Includes before/after examples.
**Hook:** "Imagine writing a novel where every sentence must be exactly 40 characters long, appear for precisely 1.5 seconds, and make a stranger in Tokyo cry at the same moment as a stranger in Brooklyn."

### 3. "Lost in Translation? More Like Found: Why Subtitles Are Cinema's Secret Weapon"
**Category:** Industry / Thought Leadership
**Why:** Argues that subtitles don't diminish films — they enhance them. Counters the common "I don't watch subtitled movies" resistance. Great for film lovers and producers who want to understand the value of quality localization. Based on the industry report data about global streaming growth.
**Summary:** Explores how subtitles became the gateway to the global streaming revolution — from *Parasite* to *Squid Game* to *Lupin*. Argues that the translator is the invisible co-author of every international hit. Uses data on streaming growth and the "1-inch barrier" quote from Bong Joon-ho. Discusses how bad subtitles can kill a masterpiece and good ones can make it universal.
**Hook:** "Bong Joon-ho said it best: 'Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.' I've spent my career building that one-inch bridge."

### 4. "What AI Gets Wrong About Translation (And Why Your Favorite Show Might Suffer)"
**Category:** Industry / AI & Human Craft
**Why:** The AI-in-translation debate is hot. Rather than being anti-tech, Laura takes a nuanced, practitioner's view — what AI does well (rough transcription), where it fails catastrophically (humor, register, cultural context), and why the hybrid model needs human craft at its center. Based heavily on both research reports.
**Summary:** Uses concrete examples of AI translation failures — the *Lupin* "dubtitle" controversy, the flattening of character voice, the loss of *tu/vous* social dynamics. Explains MTPE (Machine Translation Post-Editing) and why "fixing" a machine translation can be harder than translating from scratch. Ends with a positive vision of AI as a tool that handles the grunt work so humans can focus on the art.
**Hook:** "The machine translated it perfectly. Every word was correct. And yet, the joke was dead, the tension was gone, and the character sounded like a customer service bot. Welcome to the uncanny valley of AI subtitling."

### 5. "Cannes at 3 AM: What Happens When a Film Premiere Depends on Your Subtitles"
**Category:** Behind the Scenes / Storytelling
**Why:** Cannes is the ultimate brand signal for quality. This article turns a high-pressure work experience into a thriller narrative. Shows Laura's ability to perform under extreme pressure while educating readers about DCP delivery, simulation sessions, and the stakes of festival subtitling.
**Summary:** A narrative account of what it's like to subtitle a film for its Cannes premiere — the overnight sessions, the director making last-minute dialogue changes, the DCP delivery window, the simulation in an empty theater at dawn. Explains why festival subtitling is the hardest kind and why errors are unforgivable. References real technical constraints (DCP specs, CineCanvas format, no-replacement policy).
**Hook:** "The screening was in nine hours. The director had just recut the final scene. And I was staring at a subtitle file that no longer matched the film."

---

### 6. "600 Pages, Two Languages, One Voice: My Year Inside a Book Translation"
**Category:** Literary Translation / Long-form Storytelling
**Why:** Showcases Laura's range beyond subtitling. Translating a 600+ page book for Michel Lafon is a marathon, not a sprint. This article explores the difference between subtitle sprints and literary marathons, and how both require maintaining a consistent voice.
**Summary:** Laura describes the experience of translating *Maitre de l'Air* — the daily rhythm, the challenge of maintaining stylistic coherence across 600+ pages, the relationship with the publisher, and why literary translation requires disappearing into someone else's voice for months. Contrasts with the intensity of subtitling (where you have seconds, not chapters). Explores the concept of "author's voice" preservation.
**Hook:** "In subtitling, I have 1.5 seconds to get it right. In book translation, I had a year. Somehow, the year was harder."

---

### 7. "Tu or Vous? The Social Dynamics That Subtitles Can't Show You"
**Category:** Language & Culture / Deep Dive
**Why:** The *tu/vous* distinction is one of the most fascinating FR→EN translation challenges. It's relatable to anyone who's studied French, and reveals the invisible social architecture that subtitles struggle to convey. Great for the culturally curious reader.
**Summary:** Explores the *tu/vous* system as a window into French social dynamics — hierarchy, intimacy, power plays — and the translator's impossible task of conveying it in English. Uses examples from *Call My Agent!* where the switch from *vous* to *tu* marks a romantic or professional turning point. Discusses strategies: first names vs. last names, formality shifts, the limits of workarounds.
**Hook:** "In French, you can declare love, establish dominance, or destroy a friendship — just by choosing one word over another. In English, we have... 'you.'"

---

### 8. "The Invisible Author: Why Translators Deserve Screen Credits (And French Law Agrees)"
**Category:** Industry / Rights & Recognition
**Why:** Most people don't know translators are legally recognized as authors in France. This is a powerful positioning article — it frames Laura's work within a legal and cultural tradition of authorship, not service provision. Based on the research report's section on droit d'auteur and SACEM/SCAM.
**Summary:** Explains the French legal framework where audiovisual translators are authors — with moral rights, attribution rights, and royalties through SACEM/SCAM. Contrasts with the US "work for hire" model. Argues that recognizing translators as authors leads to better quality. Discusses the practical impact: credits, royalties, the right to refuse alterations.
**Hook:** "In the United States, I'd be a vendor. In France, I'm an author. The subtitles you read at the bottom of the screen? Legally, they're mine — and the law says you have to put my name in the credits."

---

### 9. "Why Your International Release Deserves Better Than 'Good Enough' Subtitles"
**Category:** Quality / Boutique vs. Industrial
**Why:** Without being salesy, this makes the case for quality over volume. Uses the industry report's "Zoo vs. Lab" framework to explain why premium content needs premium translation. Aimed at producers and distributors.
**Summary:** Describes the two-tier reality of the AVT industry: the industrial "bulk" pipeline (template workflows, squeezed rates, MTPE) vs. the boutique approach (collaboration with directors, simulation sessions, cultural adaptation). Uses the *Lupin* dubtitle controversy as a cautionary tale. Shows that for prestige content — festival films, auteur series, literary adaptations — the cost of "good enough" is higher than the cost of "great."
**Hook:** "There are two ways to subtitle a film. One costs less. The other one gets you into Cannes."

---

### 10. "Between Two Tongues: What Living Bilingually Taught Me About Translation"
**Category:** Personal / Philosophical
**Why:** Explores the lived experience of bilingualism — not as a professional skill but as a way of being. Deep, reflective, shareable. Appeals to anyone who has ever lived between two cultures or languages.
**Summary:** A personal meditation on what it means to think in two languages. Laura explores the moments where French and English diverge — the untranslatable emotions, the words that exist in one language but not the other, the way her personality shifts slightly depending on which language she's speaking. Connects this to her craft: a translator doesn't just know two languages — they *live* in the space between them.
**Hook:** "I argue differently in French than I do in English. I'm funnier in French, more precise in English. And somewhere in between those two versions of myself, I found my career."
